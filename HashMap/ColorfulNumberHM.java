/*
For Given Number A find if its COLORFUL number or not.
If number A is a COLORFUL number return 1 else return 0.
What is a COLORFUL Number: ->
A number can be broken into different contiguous sub-subsequence parts.
Suppose, a number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245.
And this number is a COLORFUL number, since product of every digit of a contiguous subsequence is different.

1 <= A <= 2 * 10^9
Input 1:  A = 23
Explanation 1:
 Possible Sub-sequences: [2, 3, 23] where
 2 -> 2
 3 -> 3
 23 -> 6  (product of digits)
 This number is a COLORFUL number since product of every digit of a sub-sequence are different.
